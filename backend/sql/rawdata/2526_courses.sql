In addition to, and intertwined with, human-induced climate change—which will be a defining challenge of the 21st century—we can anticipate greater incidents of wildfires (and other “natural” disasters), loss of biodiversity, food and water insecurity, climate migration, and even armed conflict over dwindling resources.

But this famed mountain range also figures centrally in the European imagination and in fact coheres an entire region all its own. Indeed, the Alpine region is more cohesive and uniform than we might think, especially since it spans at least six different countries. Interestingly, culture, economy, and ecology in the Alps is remarkably consistent, and Alpine “tradition” and “innovation” are fascinating windows into the dynamics of this fabled region.This course is designed to make the myth of the German-speaking Alps real, meaningful, and unforgettable. Our course will begin in Switzerland with a hands-on exploration of Alpine artisanry and industry (from cheese-making to woodcutting and everything in between), augmented with some breathtaking climbs, cogwheel mountain trains, and practice learning to play the Alpine horn. From there we will pivot to Tyrol, the historic Alpine region spanning southern Germany, central Austria, and northern Italy. To investigate Tyrol, we will go first to Innsbruck (Austria) and, among other things, meet with the Austrian Alpine Society, hike the Austrian Alps, and descend into a historic silver mine. Then we will head south to Bozen (Italy), which affords us easy access to “Dorf Tirol,” the castle and land of the ruling family and namesake of this still very German-speaking (though now, since 1917, nominally Italian) region. We will also immerse ourselves in Tyrolean culture, for example by taking yodeling lessons there and practicing our new skills while hiking. Our time in Bozen will also be punctuated by meetings and workshops with several departments at the University of Bozen, including Mountain Environmental Sciences; Tourism, Sport, and Event Management; and Enogastronomy.Students will return from this off-campus course with concrete, specific knowledge of how and why Alpine life functions, then and now, and a collection of experiences and visual memories that will nourish a love of the Alps for a lifetime to come.A note on the physical, athletic requirements of this course:This course will include numerous semi-serious hiking excursions, to say nothing of a lot of walking in hilly places at elevation. We will not do any technical climbing or hiking in snow or otherwise dangerous locations, and we will certainly not be in a race or in a hurry; but traversing trails in the Alps requires a different kind of physicality and endurance than your typical class (even your typical off-campus class). Students should think carefully and honestly about whether they will be able to participate meaningfully in class in these environments and activities. Enrolled students should also do some pre-conditioning over the summer to prepare for hiking and walking at elevation (ca. 3000 m above sea level).Required Supplies (purchased on your own)-one pair hiking sticks (e.g. Leki trekking poles @ $90)-hiking boots-international cell phone data plan','','Humanities, Intercultural Literacy Intensive'),

With the rise of Gothic literature in England came a newfound appreciation for monsters: they were not only horrifying and dangerous but also appealing in oblique ways. They were terrifying precisely because they were attractive and evil. Gothic monstrosity was therefore suitable to be used for a variety of critical ends: to underscore fears of female sexuality; to represent anxieties about racial and ethnic Others; and to critique other religions. In this course, we will consume eighteenth and nineteenth-century Gothic texts alongside the modern stories inspired by their legacy.

We will explore, from a multinational perspective, the ways in which the dominant nation states competed for both power and security in what was perceived to be the new world order. We will seek to understand the ways in which the Great Powers attempted to balance their national needs for economic and military security, with their desires for international prominence and stability.This course will also examine the origins of the Cold War in Europe and Asia. We will trace the expansion of the Cold War from its origins in Europe to its extension to the peripheral states in Asia and Latin America. Some themes that we will cover will include: (1) the importance of the proxy conflicts as both Cold War front lines and Cold War determinants; (2) decolonization and the end of the modern European empires; (3) the rise of China and the significance of Sino-Soviet competition; (4) the nuclear age and the arms race; (5) the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union; and (6) the struggle to construct the post-Cold War international order.

Instead of focusing on variables, angles, and continuous equations, in discrete mathematics we learn to work with a collection of objects that are arranged in structures such as sets, functions, sequences, etc. Moreover, we must learn the basics of logical reasoning and techniques that prove statements to be true. Therefore, this course will emphasize the following topics: logic and set theory, proof methods and mathematical induction, counting and probability, and discrete structures such as functions, sequences, relations, matrices, and graphs. Other topics may be introduced, time permitting. Open to students with three years of high school math. Trigonometry not required.
